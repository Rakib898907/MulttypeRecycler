# multetype_itemView_recyclerView

RecyclerView Multiple View We can add multiple views in a RecyclerView. For example, the feed page on Facebook is an example of Multiple View. You can add image, or video, or text or a combination of all in the same RecyclerView.

Another example can be WhatsApp chatting. The message that we send can be thought to be placed in a RecyclerView. So, when you send the message, it appears on the right-hand side of the screen. But if someone from the other side sends a message, then it appears on the left-hand side. So, there is a change in the view type.

In this blog, we will learn how to do this. We will create a RecyclerView and add two different views into it. You can create more view types according to your use-case.
